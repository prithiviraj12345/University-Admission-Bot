🏗️ System Architecture – University Admissions Bot
This document describes the overall architecture of the University Admissions Bot, explaining how user queries are processed and how admission information is delivered efficiently.

📌 Architecture Overview
The University Admissions Bot follows a modular chatbot architecture consisting of a user interface, processing layer, and data layer.
It is designed to provide fast, accurate, and structured responses to admission-related queries.

🔍 Component Description
1. User Interface
Accepts user queries in natural language
Displays chatbot responses
Can be web-based or console-based
2. Chat Interface / Input Handler
Captures user input
Validates and preprocesses text
Forwards queries to the NLP layer
3. NLP / Intent Processing
Identifies user intent (eligibility, fees, deadlines, etc.)
Extracts key entities (course name, program type)
Routes the query to the appropriate logic module
4. Business Logic Layer
Matches identified intent with stored admission rules
Applies response logic
Formats answers in a user-friendly way
5. Knowledge Base
Stores admission-related data
Implemented using JSON / CSV / database
Contains:
Program details
Eligibility criteria
Required documents
Application timelines
🔄 Data Flow
User enters a question
Input handler processes the text
NLP engine detects intent and entities
Business logic fetches relevant data
Response is generated and sent back to the user
🧠 Design Principles
Modularity – Each component works independently
Scalability – Easy to add new programs or FAQs
Maintainability – Clear separation of logic and data
Efficiency – Compressed and fast responses
🚀 Future Enhancements
Integration with live university databases
Multi-language support
Voice-based interaction
AI-powered response generation
Analytics and user feedback tracking
📌 Conclusion
The University Admissions Bot architecture ensures a structured, scalable, and efficient system that simplifies the admission process for students through conversational interaction.
